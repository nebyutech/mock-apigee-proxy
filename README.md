# Mock Apigee API Proxy

This repository simulates an Apigee API proxy setup. It includes basic configurations that mimic the structure and functionality of a real Apigee proxy.

## Project Structure

- **apiproxy/**: Contains the mock proxy configuration files.
  - **proxies/**: Proxy endpoint configuration (simulates ProxyEndpoint).
  - **targets/**: Target endpoint configuration (simulates TargetEndpoint).
  - **policies/**: Simulated policies like RaiseFault.
  - **resources/**: Additional resources, such as custom scripts.
  - **jsc/**: JavaScript files for custom logic.

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate what an Apigee proxy might look like in a version-controlled environment.
